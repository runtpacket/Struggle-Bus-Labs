## Struggle Bus Labs V2.3824

Welcome to Struggle Bus Labs.

![Struggle Bus Labs](SBL.jpg)

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage with my Voron 2.4 350mm 3D Printer, I have named the Struggle Bus!

My Struggle Bus journey started on my 35th Anniversary, my wife was very generous and let me purchase my Dream 3D printer. It was also on our anniversary that we found out I would be having a quadruple bypass in a few weeks. My Printer build quickly became my escape. I set about trying to get as much as I could get done prior to surgery. it was nice to hyper focus and forget my worries. The surgery was everything you think and then some. took me a long time to get where I felt comfortable trying to work on the printer, it was at least 6 months before I even considered flipping it to work on electronics. Sadly, it’s taken me a long time to get close to where I was cognitively, I'm still dealing with a bit of [pumphead]( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pumphead-heart-lung-machine/). My heart is doing well. I'm doing well and just like with my sternum. Everyday my brain gets stronger too. 

## My Build

[Formbot Voron 2.4R1 350mm Kit.](https://www.formbot3d.com/products/voron-24-pro-corexy-3d-printer-kit-with-hdmi-5-touch-screen?VariantsId=10486)

Dragon Std hot End, I print a lot of PLA. 

Quality rails on x and y

old mgn9's and mgn 12 will be as backer rod's to mitigate thermal expansion. 

Planning to use CPAP Fan for remote cooling with a 2.4 Top hat with rear umbilical

[Voron R2 Updates](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/releases)

Frame Black. Primary printed parts color is black with KVP Galaxy Blue and Polymaker blue accents. I am using vinyl flat cap (blue and black) as rail fillers/cable covers.

X and Y upgraded to West 3d Berserker’s. [X rail](https://west3d.com/products/berserker-mgn12h-1r-300-350-400-linear-rails-viking-skis-with-carriages?variant=43506758025428) and [y Rails](https://west3d.com/products/berserker-mgn9h-1r-150-300-350-400-linear-rails-viking-skis-with-carriages?variant=43506738856148)

Z rails are Formbot vivedino's. The Berserker's were nice and clean when they arrived. I cleaned with ISO and lubed the rails with EP2. So far I have used 1/4 of the syringe. Lots left for maintenance. 

# Panel's

[Printed Solid ACM Panel Kit](https://www.printedsolid.com/products/voron-v2-panel-set-made-from-aluminum-composite-material)

Have not touched the stock PC Panels. Might use them in the future for another build.

# Printer Display 
[BTT LCD12864](https://www.printables.com/model/351939-voron-24-lcd-display-mod)

[BTT LCD12864 GitHub](https://github.com/bigtreetech/MINI-12864)

Stock Display panel didn't stay in down position and felt floppy.  very happy with this design. 

# Webcam

[Wansview 1080P web cam](https://github.com/runtpacket/Struggle-Bus-Labs/tree/main/Mods/WebCAM/wansview-1080p-camera-mount-model_files)

Pretty impressed with this $9 amazon special. Made me recall how crazy web cam prices got during covid. It would have been a $250 camera then. Lol

# Filament Runout Sensor

[BTT Smart Filament Sensor](https://github.com/bigtreetech/smart-filament-detection-module/tree/master/V1.0)

Needs lubed and shimmed. Turned off as I need to troubleshoot false positives..

# Probe

[Chaotic Labs Tap v1](https://github.com/Chaoticlab/CNC-Tap-for-Voron)

1/29/2024 - During gantry rail upgrade I hulked a screw on the belt holder. sometimes I don’t know my own strength. Special not CL v2 is incompatible with the Mellow Fly Canbus board. Need to go through parts I may have a printed tap and all the bits and pieces needed to get back to printing. 

# CanBUS

[Mellow Fly SB2040 v1 KB3D Guide](https://wiki.kb-3d.com/home/mellow/voron/mellow_sb2040)

[Mellow SB2040v1](https://github.com/Mellow-3D/Fly-SB2040)

Mellow Fly SB2040 V2 released the magic smoke. I had just started a print and watched the printer start to home when I saw the smoke. Opened up the stealth burner to find a capacitor was missing. It looked to be cold soldered. This led to a mofsit spewing it's guts. Fast replacement thanks to KB3D.

The Mellow Fly SB2040 v1 and v2 are incompatible with the Chaotics Labs CNC Tap V2. 


# Umbilical

I built my umbilical cable using 2mm PTFE alongside the SB2040 Canbus cable inside 1/8" Sleeving. So far I find the PTFE to be perfect.

## Self inflicted wounds

Chaotic labs Tap v1. Over tightened the belt holder screw. I wasn't trying. but the aluminum didn’t care.

RelaBot amazon el cheapo Rail. ummm did I forget to lube that rail. Yup! Was printing like a dream, then layer shift and it sounds Crunchy!

vivedino mgn8 400mm damn those bearing are small and all over the floor. Oh wtf they have grease ports. 

## Build Plates Wall o Shame

What can I say. Let me build a klicky probe and make art. Here are a couple of master pieces.
